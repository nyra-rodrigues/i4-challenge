Identifying Peak Congestion Times
What are the peak traffic hours for different locations?
Are there consistent congestion patterns across all locations, or do they vary significantly?
How does traffic volume vary by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)?
Do weekdays have higher congestion than weekends?
Are there specific hours where bus congestion is more pronounced?


How does bus traffic compare to private vehicle congestion in different locations?
Do high-congestion locations correlate with high bus traffic? If so, can bus lanes help?
Which areas have high congestion but low bus ridership, indicating potential for increased public transit solutions?
Are locations with high pedestrian and cyclist traffic also high in vehicle congestion?
