# Toronto Traffic Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real-time traffic data from multiple intersections in Toronto, identifying patterns of traffic congestion, and providing actionable insights to optimize the city's transportation system. The main goal is to enhance the flow of traffic, reduce congestion, and improve overall sustainability and public safety.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Data Analysis**: Analyzed vehicle, pedestrian, and bike traffic data from various intersections.
- **Congestion Pattern Identification**: Identified key areas and times of traffic slowdowns and bottlenecks.
- **Route Optimization**: Developed data-driven solutions to optimize bus routes and improve traffic flow at critical points in the city.
- **Visualization**: Utilized various data visualization techniques to present the findings clearly and effectively, including heatmaps, time-series analysis, and congestion charts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Git**: Version control and project management.

## Data Sources

- Real-time traffic data collected from intersections across Toronto, including vehicle, pedestrian, and bike traffic volumes.
